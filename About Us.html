		<h2> <b> About Job Miner </b> </h2>
		
		<br></br><p> Are you a job seeker? Aren't you tired of looking through job descriptions after job descriptions to find the perfect job for you? Well, Job Miner was built and designed with a goal of making job seekers' lives easier. We are all job seekers who got tired of getting excited from seeing, for example, a Software Developer position, only to realize that we have absolutely none of the required skills! Some job titles like Software Developers can have a very broad range of skills required (ex. C/C++, Java, C#, Ruby on Rails, etc). As much as we would like to learn everything, we don't know everything! We also don't want to waste 5 mins reading a job description that does not meet our skills and expertise. So.... we decided to make Job Miner! You can enter the skills you have, and Job Miner will take a look at the job description and evalution how much you match with a job! It's basically Tinder... Except you are being matched with a job instead another person... Same thing. </p>
